chrome-localhost
================
Chrome Store link:
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/localhost/mjhkaggimgaoooehpggbjkankpbkmcjl?utm_source=chrome-ntp-icon

It's pretty simple:

1. Download the `chrome-localhost` folder.
2. In Chrome, go to _Wrench > Tools > Extensions_
3. Check the _Developer Mode_ box at the top.
4. Click the _Pack extension..._ box.
5. Navigate to and pack the `chrome-localhost` directory.
6. Run the `.crx` file.

If you run into any issues installing with the `.crx` file, try dragging the `.crx` file onto your _Extensions_ page.
